  not run against the real API).

## Links
- PR: https://github.com/telegen-glitch/telegen-web/pull/1 (branch `claude/telegen-production-build-sv94k7`)
- Preview: waiting for Vercel's first deployment on the PR.

## NOT DONE / NOT VERIFIED

- Reference screenshots (fellos.nl, numan.com, manual.co, hims.com): blocked by network policy (403).
  `docs/parity-spec.md` is written from the known category pattern and must be re-checked.
- GitHub CI and the Vercel preview: in progress on PR #1.
- Phase 5 Sanity: interface ready (`src/content/source.ts`); needs project id/token.
- Structured data validated by our own tests (parse + mirrors visible content); Google Rich Results
  Test not run (no network access to it).

## NEXT

1. Get CI green and the Vercel preview link on PR #1; owner reviews the preview on a phone.
2. Reference capture → visual parity passes (3 loops) against real screenshots.
3. Sanity adapter behind `ContentSource` once credentials arrive.

## BLOCKED (owner-only)

- Allow reference domains in the environment's network settings, or send phone screenshots.
- Later: company details, clinicians, prices, Brevo account/API key (owner approved Brevo), lawyer review, Sanity credentials.
